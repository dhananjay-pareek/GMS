## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

Two Docker image variants are available:

| Image | Tag | Browser Engine | Best For |

| Playwright (default) | `latest`, `vX.X.X` | Playwright | Most users, better stability |
| Rod | `latest-rod`, `vX.X.X-rod` | Rod/Chromium | Lightweight, faster startup |

```bash
# Playwright version (default)
docker pull gosom/google-maps-scraper

# Rod version (alternative)
docker pull gosom/google-maps-scraper:latest-rod
```
